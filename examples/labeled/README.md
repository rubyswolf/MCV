Here are some real labelled examples of scenes with points selected with MCV and their corresponding ingame world coordinates. Ground truths are provided that were extracted using `/data` and the PnP predictions are provided for comparison. You can use these to test out the PnP system and see how accurately it performs on real data. You can teleport to the original locations within the maps used to verify there's no lying about the ground truth coordinates. You can also try your own examples to show this isn't cherry-picked and it really has subpixel precision (a pixel is a 16th of a block in Minecraft using the standard 16x16 textures).
